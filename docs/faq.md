# Frequently Asked Questions

### I am using neither GitHub Actions nor GitLab, can I still use Chainloop?

Yes, Chainloop is runner agnostic, which means that you can run the attestation anywhere, including your laptop!

That said, there are [benefits](/reference/operator/contract#runner-context) for using one of our [supported runner types](/reference/operator/contract#runner-context). We plan on supporting more CI vendors so your is not supported yet, please [contact us](https://us21.list-manage.com/contact-form?u=801f42b3abafc40b1a17c5f25&form_id=3f3bbfe15e6fcd4a60be9b966652cfd5) with your preference and we will get back to you.

### Will Chainloop be Open Source?

Yes, we are committed to making Chainloop Open source. We are working out the details. Stay tuned!

### Does Chainloop store my Artifacts and Attestation

No. They are stored in [your OCI Registry](/getting-started/setup#add-oci-repository).
