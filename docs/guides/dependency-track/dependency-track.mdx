> [Dependency-Track](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track) is an intelligent Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain.
> Dependency-Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

Chainloop can be configured to **automatically send any [CycloneDX Software Bill Of Materials](https://cyclonedx.org/)** that has been received as part of an attestation **to a Dependency-Track instance**.

If you have defined in your [Workflow Contract](/reference/operator/contract) a material of type `SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON`. This SBOM file, **in addition to being stored in your OCI registry, will be sent to Dependency-Track**.

## Configure Integration

There are two steps involved to enable this integration:

1. Setup a Dependency-Track integration provider in your Chainloop account
2. Attach this integration instance to your workflow

### Prerequisites

**Dependency-Track API token**

An API token is required for the Chainloop instance to communicate securely with DependencyTrack. The required permissions are `BOM_UPLOAD`, `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` (to validate that the provided project ID exists) and optionally `PROJECT_CREATION_UPLOAD` if `project-auto-creation` is enabled, more on that later.

The API Key can be created by going to Settings -> Access Management -> Teams -> Select (or create) a Team -> Set permissions -> Copy API key

### 1 - Setup the integration in your Chainloop account

Using the [Chainloop CLI](/getting-started/installation), you can add an instance of Dependency-Track that later on can be attached to any of your workflows. This is done via the `chainloop config integration add dependency-track` command with three inputs.

```bash
$ chainloop config integration add dependency-track -h
Add Dependency-Track integration

Usage:
  chainloop config integration add dependency-track [flags]

Flags:
      --allow-project-auto-create   Allow auto-creation of projects or require to always specify an existing one
      --instance string             dependency track instance URL
```

Let's go ahead and add an integration for an instance hosted at https://dependency-track.chainloop.dev that allows the auto-creation of projects. You'll get a prompt to introduce the API key

```
$ chainloop config integration add dependency-track add --instance https://dependency-track.chainloop.dev --allow-project-auto-create
┌──────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ ID                                   │ KIND             │ CONFIG                                       │ CREATED AT          │

│                                      │                  │ allowAutoCreate: true                        │                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### 2 - Attach the Integration to a Workflow

Once the integration is live, it can be attached to any workflow. In practice, that means that every workflow attestation that is received that contains a `SBOM_CYCLONEDX_JSON` material will be forwarded.

:::note
The same integration can be attached to multiple workflows
:::

The attachment is done via `chainloop workflow integration attach dependency-track` command.

During the attachment process, you can decide whether to send the SBOMs to a specific project (`--project-id`) or create a new one defined by the provided `--project-name`. For the latter to work, you need to make sure that the integration was setup with `--allow-project-auto-create` option.

```bash
$ chainloop workflow integration attach dependency-track -h
Attach a Dependency-Track integration to this workflow

Usage:
  chainloop workflow integration attach dependency-track [flags]

Flags:
      --integration string    ID of the integration already registered in this organization
      --project-id string     Identifier of the Dependency-Track you want this integration to talk to
      --project-name string   Create a project with the provided name instead of using an existing one
      --workflow string       ID of the workflow to attach this integration
```

:::note
The workflowID can be found by running `chainloop workflow list`
:::

```bash
$ chainloop workflow integration attach dependency-track \
    --project-name example-project \
    --integration c48f3041-5745-4773-aed9-ccf2f288b2e4 \
    --workflow b0c0c6a8-b98c-4acf-97f6-480a08a79ae7
```

That's all!

Next time Chainloop receives an attestation, its contained SBOMs will be uploaded to https://dependency-track.chainloop.dev to a project called `example-project`.

## CI setup example

[Here](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml) you can find a Github Action example where based on [this workflow contract](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/contracts/release.cue) it

- Initializes the Chainloop attestation.
- Creates an SBOM using `anchore/sbom-action@v0` syft action.
- Adds the SBOM material and send the attestation to Chainloop.

Then Chainloop is configured similarly to what was shown above to send the received SBOM to Dependency-Track.
