We are excited to announce that **[Chainloop is now Open Source](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop)**! ðŸŽ‰

<!--truncate-->

This [has been a top priority](https://docs.chainloop.dev/blog/touching-base-one-month-in#is-chainloop-open-source-i-want-to-run-my-own-instance) for our early users, and we are thrilled to finally make it happen. You are now able to deploy your own instance of Chainloop on your organization's on-premise or cloud infrastructure.

By open-sourcing Chainloop, we hope to encourage transparency, collaboration and contribution from the community. We'd like to thank existing contributors and welcome any future ones!

Got a question, comment, or idea? Please don't hesitate to reach out through [GitHub](https://github.com/chainloop-dev/chainloop/issues) or our new [Discord Community Server](https://discord.gg/f7atkaZact), **come in and say hi!**.

It feels like yesterday when we started working on Chainloop, and we are so grateful for the support we've received so far. We are excited to see what the future holds!

Cheers,
Miguel
